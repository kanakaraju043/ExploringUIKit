### Titbit 2 - Chat Messages using UITableView

Using UITableView, it is easy to create user interface for chat messages. Programmatically creating the chat messages UI using UITableView gives you fine-grained control over the appearance and behavior of the interface. You can customize the table view cells, handle user interactions, and implement features like message threading, timestamps, and multimedia attachments according to your requirements.

### Titbit 3 - Photo Gallery with Zoom in/out

UICollectionView is a powerful component that allows you to display and manage a collection of items in a grid-like or custom layout. It provides a flexible foundation for creating various types of interfaces, including photo galleries. It's important to note that implementing zoom in/out functionality can involve more complex logic, such as managing zoom scales, calculating zoom levels, and handling gesture interactions. But, you can implement all of these features easily by programatically.

**Learning stack:**

- How to create a grid layout with equal spacing around UICollectionView items?
- Perform actions like Save, Share, Copy, and Delete operations on an image by showing the context menu.
- Show a photo gallery with all photos and a selected index.
- Implement a zoom in/out feature using UIScrollView.
- Set the zoom scale according to the image size. 

and many other things...
